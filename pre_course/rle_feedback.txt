Notes - attempting on an ONS machine

After reading through the readme I came here.

I opened the .ipynb though newcomers to python programming may be wondering what to do first.

Package_and_data_installer.ipynb - is it necessary for me to use a virtual environment in order
to get up and running in the course? Reading through the articles is fairly involved and represents
a sizeable hurdle to getting up and running. Do the problematic packages affect certain sections
more than others? If so, would it be better to move those sections to supplementary material?

pip install -r requirements.txt asked for the artifactory dance then failed with
```
  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement appnope==0.1.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1)) (from versions: )
No matching distribution found for appnope==0.1.0 (from -r requirements.txt (line 1))
```

Had JM show me how to set up venv and then run into artifactory issues. Generated new art key.

JM produced venv guidance which helped me progress further. Committed to this directory under venv_guidance.html.

Some venv-jupyter errors encountered preventing installation of all required packages.

Recorded state of successfully installed packages under success_installs.txt

Package_and_data_installer.ipynb
pip instal cells: 
```
# The below code will install all the required versions of packages to your **current** kernel
# only try if the above does not work
import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

result in error:
```
'c:\users\leyshr\onedrive' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

This may be due to spaces in the pathname for onedrive locations.


Now arriving at section ## NLP data from packages, I see that I need to use binder. Suggest putting a link to the required
solution and shifting this guidance upstream.

Also, considering the advice to create the venv within the pre_course folder, will I then be able to use jupyter notebooks
to interact in scripts above this level, ie `../notebooks/M1 - Intro to NLP.ipynb`. I suspect learners will then need to
delete the implemented steps and repeat at a higher level in the directory tree.
