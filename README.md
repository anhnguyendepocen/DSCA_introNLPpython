Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python

**Course Summary**

Natural Language Processing is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. 
It is used for processing and analysing large amounts of natural language. 
Some applications include search engines (Google), text classification (spam filters),
identifying sentiments for a product (sentiment analysis), methods for discovering 
abstract topics in a collection of documents (topic modelling) and machine translation technologies.
Concepts covered include cleaning, exploring datasets through methods rooted in Corpus Linguistics,
and application of feature engineering techniques to transform textual data into a numerical representation.
Key techniques such as word embeddings and language modelling are also introduced as well as illustrations
as to how they can be performed over a dataset.

**Learning Outcome**

Participants should gain competancy in using core techniques to handle natural language content to undertake analysis to detect patterns and derive insights for development of applications like mentioned in course summary

**Intended Audience**

Open to all (who fulfil) basic pre-requisites and who have in interest in this field. It would be
particularly relevant to those who deal regularly with natural language at scale.

**Learning Objective**

At the end of this course participants will be able to:

*	Describe the main components of language structure
*	Perform pre-processing (cleaning) operations on text.
*	Apply methods from Corpus Linguistics to garner greater insights on a corpus.
*	Produce word-clouds, bar charts and other basic visualisations on variables of interest.
*	Produce clusters using the k-means algorithm to uncover patterns in a corpus
*	Transform text to vectors using approaches delineated.
*	Produce word embeddings on a corpus 
*	Calculate the probability of a sentence using a language modelling approach


**Course Type** (Fixed length list.)

* E learning - Available 
* Self learning -  Not Available
