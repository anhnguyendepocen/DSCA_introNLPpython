Introduction to Natural Language Processing in Python

**Course Summary**

Natural Language Processing is a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence. 
It is used for processing and analysing large amounts of unstructured text data. 
Some applications include search engines (Google), text classification (spam filters),
quantifying opinion from bodies of text (sentiment analysis), methods for discovering 
abstract topics in a collection of documents (topic modelling) and machine translation technologies.
Concepts covered include cleaning, exploring datasets through methods rooted in analysis of real language
and application of feature engineering techniques to transform textual data into a numerical representation.
Key techniques such as word embeddings and language modelling are also introduced as well as illustrations
as to how they can be performed over a dataset.

**Course Objective**

Participants should gain competency in using core natural language techniques in detecting patterns and deriving insights for
development of applications.

**Intended Audience**

Open to all who fulfil basic pre-requisites. It would be
particularly relevant to those who deal regularly with natural language at scale.

**Learning Objective Detail**

At the end of this course participants will be able to:

*	Describe the main components of language structure
*	Perform pre-processing (cleaning) operations on text.
*	Apply methods from Corpus Linguistics to garner greater insights on a corpus.
*	Produce word-clouds, bar charts and other basic visualisations on variables of interest.
*	Produce clusters using the k-means algorithm to uncover patterns in a corpus
*	Transform text to vectors using approaches delineated.
*	Produce word embeddings on a corpus 
*	Calculate the probability of a sentence using a language modelling approach


**Course Type**
