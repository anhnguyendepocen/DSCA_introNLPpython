    "## About this module\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will introduce basic concepts in regular expressions through using a case study. The regular expression theory in this course is largely language agnostic, in that all major programming language implement them in a similar manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "The beginning of the course will be conducted using a website tool, [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/) that helps us easily test expressions. Later on we will look at how to use regular expressions in python and with data sets in `pandas`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are they for?\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions are a useful tool when we have text data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often when using text data we want to find out if the text meets some criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some example things we might want to check the text data for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* if it starts with the letter \"B\"\n",
    "* if the all the letters in it are capitalised\n",
    "* if the text ends in a question mark \"?\"\n",
    "* whether the text contains a specific keyword, like a name or location\n",
    "\n",
    "These checks can mostly be done using our programming knowledge about strings and looping through the data. To check for the starting letting in a text we can check the first element, we can loop over all text and check if each letter is capitalised, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are more complicated checks we may need to make on our text data. These are going to be harder to do by indexing and looping though the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some harder tasks to achieve are checking:\n",
    "* whether the text is a valid email\n",
    "* if a password meets some security requirement\n",
    "* whether an phone number follows a valid format\n",
    "* if a mistake has been made when inputting some data manually\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this password security example if we had four security requirements: must contain at least one uppercase and lowercase letter, must have at least one digit and must be longer than 8 characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../pics/password.jpg\" alt=\"Password checker\"\n",
    "\ttitle=\"Password verification\" width=\"400\" height=\"200\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To check a given password for this criteria we would need to program a very specific solution such as:\n",
    "* loop over every element and check whether each is uppercase or lowercase, passes if at least one element is of each\n",
    "* loop through the text and check if each element is a digit, if at least one is pass the criteria\n",
    "* count the number of elements in the string, if the length is greater than 8 pass the criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "From this it's clear that there is going to be some iteration and potentially a lot of conditions in the program to get it to work for our requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions allow us to tackle the second group of examples and similar problems more easily than using a typical string programming approach. They are used widely to search and replace parts of text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A regular expression lets us design a pattern for our specific problem. This pattern will describe what we need from the text data without needing to loop through the string ourselves, or add complex conditional statements (`if/else` statements). \n",
    "\n",
    "The above password problem can be fully described by the following regular expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "`\"^(?=.*\\d)(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-zA-Z]).{8,}$\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** you do not need to understand the above yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above text may be quite intimidating, but what they can do is extremely powerful. Regular expressions are a language themselves, but we are going to start small and the build up to more complicated expressions like the above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of the same regular expression broken into groups, each showing what we want to match from our criteria.\n",

    "* \"{n}\" - preceeding character appears `n` times\n",
    "* \"{n,}\" - preceeding character appears `n` or more times\n",
    "* \"{n,m}\" - preceeding character appears `n` or more times, but no more tham `m` times\n",

    "\n",
    "By using these in combination with the characters we want we can fit the right pattern to our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we definitely know we want a character to be present, we will use the \"+\" special character.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Be careful** when using occurance that could be present zero times, it may not pick up what you want!\n",
